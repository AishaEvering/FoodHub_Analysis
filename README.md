## 📃Description

Delved into the world of exploratory data analysis (EDA), utilizing Python's powerful data analysis libraries to uncover insights and patterns within various datasets.


## 🏫 What Did I Learn

* How act like a detective and gain insights from the data through investigation, attention to detail, and the ability to uncover hidden patterns or anomalies.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Not all Data Science involves building models.  Sometimes the ability to invesigate the data is enough.


### 😤 Where I Got Stuck

* None, this was pretty straight forward.
  
### 📖 Dataset

* I was given a dataset with 1898 rows of data.
